chord-editor
============


Provide a simple UI in order to generate chord diagrams like this:

The idea comes after a late night conversation over a glass of whisky with felespiller [Sturla Eide](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturla_Eide) who needs something similar for his guitar teaching. He also needed similar patterns for bass guitar:

(Note that, in general, you don't play an out-and-out chord on a bass guitar - you tend to play an arpeggio through the chord which in turn means that very often more than one fret on the same string needs to be fingered.  The black circle represents a primary fret position and the gray square a secondary one.)

There is also support for ukulele, [tenor guitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenor_guitar) and piano:
